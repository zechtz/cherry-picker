## üéÆ Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run in any git repository
cherry-picker

# Start with commits in reverse order
cherry-picker --reverse

# Generate default configuration file
cherry-picker --generate-config
```

### Workflow Example
1. Navigate to any branch (your current branch doesn't matter for commit selection)
2. Run `cherry-picker`
3. **Select source branch** - Choose branch containing commits you want to cherry-pick (e.g., `dev`, `main`)
4. **Select target branch** - Choose destination for cherry-picking (e.g., `staging`)
5. Tool shows commits from source branch that are NOT in target branch
6. Select commits using `Space` or `Enter`
7. Use `/` to search for specific commits if needed
8. Press `e` to execute cherry-pick (applies selected commits from source to target)
9. Handle any conflicts in the resolution interface
